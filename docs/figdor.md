Before you read the article, please read the important information below.

You will be reading through this article multiple times in careful detail. This page is to help scaffold that process, so we ask that you carefully follow this guide. This guide is broken up into four parts:

1. [Context](#context)
2. [First-pass reading](#first-pass-reading)
3. [Second-pass reading (careful annotation)](#second-pass-reading)
4. [Third-pass reading (discussion questions)](#third-pass-reading)

## Context 

Before diving into an article, it's helpful to get some context if possible. 

#### Who is the author? What are their credentials?

A quick wikipedia search reveals:

"Carrie Figdor is an Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Iowa. Her research focuses on the philosophy of mind, metaphysics, and ethics. Before pursuing a career in philosophy, Figdor was a journalist with the Associated Press for eleven years."

#### Where is the article published? Who might be the intended audience? 

The article appears in the journal *Frontiers in Communication*. According to their website:

"Frontiers in Communication publishes rigorously peer-reviewed research in areas including Political, Health, Culture, and Science and Environmental Communication."


As a quick check to see if you have the right context, answer the following question.

## First-pass Reading

Now that we have some context for the article, we can take a first pass reading of the article. [Download the pdf of the article here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HeVt66YVg_lz3ZbBETEUYBvFlm_-VuI1/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} Make sure you save a copy on your computer! If you don't have a tablet, you may want to print it out to make annotations with a pen/pencil. On this first-pass, you should only lightly annotate the document, but don't make any major annotations yet. You may just want to circle unfamiliar vocabulary or concepts though.

For example, the word "epistemic" means "relating to knowledge or to the degree of its validation". Although Figdor uses this word quite often, you can delete that word from any sentence in Figdor without significantly changing the meaning. So we suggest that you ignore the word epistemic if you find it distracting.

After you have finished the first-pass reading, answer the following two questions. **The wording is subtle, so please read carefully!**

#### Mini-question: Responsibility

-----------------------------------------

## Second-pass Reading

On this pass, you will be carefully annotating the text. We would like you to annotate every paragraph, by making two types of annotations: 

1. Summarize the main idea of each paragraph/section

2. Summarize the function of each paragraph/section

These ideas are explained in this document ["Annotating a Text.pdf"](images/Annotating a Text.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Please read the instructions and skim the example annotated text before you start on your second-pass reading. 

Once you are finished with your annotations, please [upload a pdf of your annotations using this form](https://forms.gle/qf1raXCP4kw9Wst5A){:target="_blank"}.


-----------------------------------------

## Third-pass reading

Make a final pass of your annotated copy of Figdor, and make notes about how you might answer the following discussion questions **with evidence from the text**. We will ask you about these in our class discussion on Wednesday, so have your notes handy for Wednesday's class.

+ In your own words, summarize the problem that Figdor is trying to address.

+ What is Figdor's proposed solution? What part applies to journalists? Do any parts apply to scientists?

+ What is the lay stance? Why is it problematic for journalists?

+ What is the problem with journalistic balance in science media? Does Figdor necessarily think journalistic balance is a bad thing?

+ How does a QRP differ from outright fraud?

+ Is it clear from the article whether Figdor views the role of journalists as "cheerleaders" or "watchdogs" of science?

+ What aspects of Figdor seem unclear to you? What would you like to discuss with your classmates?
