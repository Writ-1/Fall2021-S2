# Climate Change

In this case study, the main reading is a book chapter by Professor Naomi Oreskes:

Oreskes, N. (2010). My Facts Are Better Than Your Facts: Spreading Good News about Global Warming. In P. Howlett & M. Morgan (Eds.), How Well Do Facts Travel?: The Dissemination of Reliable Knowledge (pp. 136-166). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/CBO9780511762154.008 [Article pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cEDdQWghPJPJSmYK4vVptbFCUdk8yEbE/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}

## Overview and First-Pass Reading

*Set a timer now for 30 minutes so you have time for the other case studies*

#### Context

A quick introduction to Oreskes from wikipedia:

"Naomi Oreskes is an American historian of science. She became Professor of the History of Science and Affiliated Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University in 2013, after 15 years as Professor of History and Science Studies at the University of California, San Diego. She has worked on studies of geophysics, environmental issues such as global warming, and the history of science. In 2010, Oreskes co-authored Merchants of Doubt which identified some parallels between the climate change debate and earlier public controversies, notably the tobacco industry's campaign to obscure the link between smoking and serious disease."

#### Video overview (5 minutes)

Before you start into the main reading, we recommend watching this video (while taking a few notes) from the "Harvard Speaks on Climate Change" video series, where Oreskes discusses
[An Organized Campaign to Attack Climate Science](https://climatechange.environment.harvard.edu/naomi-oreskes){:target="_blank"}. 

#### First-pass reading

After that video introduction, now start on a first-pass reading of ["My Facts Are Better Than Your Facts"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cEDdQWghPJPJSmYK4vVptbFCUdk8yEbE/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. 

After you finish reading (or 30 minutes are up), please attempt the following question:

Now that you've done a first pass reading of the Climate Change Case Study, please proceed to case study [2. Food and Brand Lab](food-and-brand-lab).

**Stop here, unless you have completed all of the other case study first-pass readings and have chosen to focus on Climate Change as your selected case study.**

## Second Pass Reading

So you've chosen the Climate Change Case Study! Great choice! Definitely among the top 3 best case studies for our topic. 

Re-read ["My Facts Are Better Than Your Facts"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cEDdQWghPJPJSmYK4vVptbFCUdk8yEbE/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} and perform a detailed second-pass reading. Annotate this textbook chapter like we did for our framing pieces. This will likely take an additional 1.5-2.5 hours. Please take this time to carefully go through the subtle details this book chapter.

**Once you finish annotating**, please upload your annotations/notes [here at this Google Form](https://forms.gle/fDgz88KimHer7tEF7){:target="_blank"}.


#### Discussion questions

After annotating and before class this week, think of aspects of Oreskes work that you'd like to discuss with others. As with the previous readings, a good place to start is with the main ideas:

+ In your own words, summarize the problem that Oreskes is trying to address.

+ What are the main claims Oreskes puts forward?

+ What aspects of Oreskes seem unclear to you? What would you like to discuss with your classmates?

+ What are ways that Oreskes connects to Kahan? Find specific textual evidence from both to support the connection.

+ What are ways that Oreskes connects to Figdor? Find specific textual evidence from both to support the connection.


**These last two questions will seed our discussion this week. Please prepare typed answers to them so you can easily collaborate with your classmates (you will copy-paste these answers into a shared Google Doc, so please have them ready).**
