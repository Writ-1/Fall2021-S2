## Overview and First-Pass Reading

*Set a timer now for 30 minutes*

#### Context


##### Sheila Patek

From the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation webpage: 

"Sheila Patek is a biologist who works at the interface of evolution and physics through research on fast movement and acoustic signaling. Her research revealed the extraordinarily fast strikes and explosive fluid mechanics of mantis shrimp, the wild jaw-jumping of trap-jaw ants, the visualization of fungal ballistospores and the violin-like stick-slip friction of acoustic spiny lobsters. Iteratively moving between the physical intricacies of these remarkable biological feats and the evolutionary diversity that can reveal their historic pathways, Patek probes the interplay between the rules of physics and the evolutionary dynamics that have generated the remarkable diversity of biological systems. The principles arising from this research have the potential to yield novel approaches and insights into evolution-based engineering design. Patek received an A.B. from Harvard University, a Ph.D. from Duke University and then held a postdoctoral fellowship from the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science at the University of California Berkeley. Patek is currently a professor in the Biology Department at Duke University. She has received several honors, including the George A. Bartholomew Award for distinguished contributions to comparative physiology, a fellowship from the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University, a National Science Foundation CAREER award, and the Brilliant 10 award from Popular Science magazine. Her research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, National Geographic Society, Hellman Family Foundation, Armstrong Fund for Science, and others."

##### Jeff Flake

From wikipedia:

"Jeffry Lane Flake (born December 31, 1962) is an American politician who served as a United States Senator from Arizona from 2013 to 2019. A member of the Republican Party, Flake served in the United States House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013.

Born in Snowflake, Arizona, Flake attended Brigham Young University, from which he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in international relations, and later his Master of Arts degree in political science. In the early 1980s, he became a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in South Africa, where he learned to speak Afrikaans. After returning to the United States, Flake served as Executive Director of the Goldwater Institute, before being elected as a Republican to the House of Representatives from Arizona's 1st congressional district in 2001. He served as the representative for the 1st district until renumbering following the 2000 census redefined the district to be Arizona's 6th congressional district, which he then represented until he entered the Senate in 2013.

Flake sought the Republican nomination for the 2012 Senate election after incumbent Jon Kyl announced his retirement. He defeated Democratic candidate and former United States Surgeon General Richard Carmona in the general election. Flake was one of the bipartisan "Gang of Eight" U.S. senators that pushed an immigration reform bill through the Senate in 2013. He is known as a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, but generally voted in line with Trump's positions. On October 24, 2017, Flake announced that he would not seek re-election in 2018.

Throughout his Senate career, Flake suffered from consistently low approval ratings. In April 2013, less than three months after taking office, he had 32% approval and 51% disapproval ratings. By mid-2017, he dropped to 18% approval and 62% disapproval ratings, but recovered slightly near the end of his term, with 30% approval and 51% disapproval ratings as of July 2018.

On January 29, 2019, Flake was hired by CBS as a contributor for CBS News. He regularly appears on CBS This Morning and CBS Evening News.

...

Jeff Flake has used the phrase "traditionally conservative Republican" to describe his political preference. The non-partisan National Journal published an analysis of his 2013 voting record and gave him a composite ideological score of 65% conservative and 35% liberal. The New York Times used an analysis of the Senate's ideological composition and ranked Flake as the fourth most conservative Senator in 2017. The American Conservative Union gives Flake a lifetime 93% conservative score and the fiscally conservative Americans for Prosperity gave Flake a 98% lifetime score; the American Civil Liberties Union, an organization focused on civil rights and liberties, gave Flake a 53% rating in 2014 and a 35% rating in 2016."

#### First-pass reading

There's a lot here, so please don't feel the need to read everything on this first pass. Start on a first-pass reading of the Podcast (pro-tip: reading the transcript is faster!). Then do a first-pass reading of the original research article, the popular media articles, and the Wastebook discussion of the Shrimp Fight Club. After that, if you still have time in your 30 minute timer, then skim through some of the other materials.


After your 30 minutes are up, please attempt the following question:

Now that you've done a first pass reading of the Shrimp Fight Case Study, you now have completed a first-pass overview of all three case studies. Now is the time to decide which case study you will focus on, and do a second-pass annotated reading of the case study contents. Please make your selection on this [Case Study Sign Up Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L-Tp2dbHMG1d-6o3OvGxiLE9NP3Djk1hTeFgRjd4neU/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. There is a limit of 5 students per case study so that we can have an even discussion of the different case studies. Your choice here doesn't affect which case study you will write about in your main essay. After you've signed up, head back to the [overview page](case-study-overview) and start working on your chosen case study! 

<br> 


**Stop here, unless you have completed all of the other case study first-pass readings and have chosen to focus on Shrimp Fight Club as your selected case study.**

------------------------------------------------

## Second Pass Reading

So you've chosen the Shrimp Fight Club Case Study! Great choice! Definitely among the top 3 best case studies for our topic. 

Re-read the podcast transcript and perform a detailed second-pass reading. Annotate this transcript like we did for our framing pieces. Also identify a the other important pieces of the case study and annotate them as well. We recommend that you include the original popular media articles in your detailed reading too. This will likely take an additional 1.5-2.5 hours. Please take this time to carefully go through the subtle details this case study. If you are interested in focusing on the interactions between scientists and the popular media in this case study, you might want to read our [optional framing piece by Peters.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nTbDkYG9xOuR6R7RGF9Q39O8aDUj4zFv/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}

**Once you finish annotating**, please upload your annotations/notes [here at this Google Form](https://forms.gle/fDgz88KimHer7tEF7){:target="_blank"}.

#### Discussion questions

After annotating and before class this week, think of aspects of the case study that you'd like to discuss with others. As with the previous readings, a good place to start is with the main ideas:

+ In your own words, summarize the events in the case study.

+ What parts did journalists play in the case study? 

+ Carefully examining the popular media articles from Simon and Yong, can you identify any common journalistic practices they are using in their articles?

+ What parts did scientists play in the case study?

+ What items from the case study did the Wastebook cite?

+ What are ways that the case study connects to Figdor? Find specific textual evidence from both to support the connection.

+ What are ways that the case study connects to Kahan? Find specific textual evidence from both to support the connection.

**These last two questions will seed our discussion this week. Please prepare typed answers to them so you can easily collaborate with your classmates (you will copy-paste these answers into a shared Google Doc, so please have them ready).**

+ (optional) What are ways that the case study connects to Peters? Find specific textual evidence from both to support the connection.
