# Kahan

Kahan, Dan M. "What is the “science of science communication”?" *Journal of Science Communication* 14 (2015): 03, Y04. [Article pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-7P587RK4vVWd0OIr7tV-1g5sikIr17V/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}

Before you read the article, please read the important information below.

As with the previous article, you will be reading through this article multiple times in careful detail. This page is to help scaffold that process, so we ask that you carefully follow this guide. This guide is broken up into the same four parts as before:

1. [Context](#context)
2. [First-pass reading](#first-pass-reading)
3. [Second-pass reading (careful annotation)](#second-pass-reading)
4. [Third-pass reading (discussion questions)](#third-pass-reading)

## Context 

Before diving into an article, it's helpful to get some context if possible. 

#### Who is the author? What are their credentials?

A quick wikipedia search reveals:

"Dan M. Kahan is the Elizabeth K. Dollard Professor of law at Yale Law School. His professional expertise is in the fields of criminal law and evidence, and he is known for his theory of cultural cognition."

And further in the article, there is a section about "The Cultural Cognition Project": 

"Kahan is best known for his work on the cultural theory of risk. This research delves into cultural cognition, which is the study of how individuals form beliefs about the amount of risk in certain situations based on their preconceived cultural group identities. Most of this work is supported by empirical and statistical analyses of group responses to pre-created hypotheticals.

Project members use the methods of various disciplines—including social psychology, anthropology, communications, and political science—to chart the impact of this phenomenon and to identify the mechanisms through which it operates. The Project also has an explicit normative objective: to identify processes of democratic decision making by which society can resolve culturally grounded differences in belief in a manner that is both congenial to persons of diverse cultural outlooks and consistent with sound public policymaking."


#### Where is the article published? Who might be the intended audience? 

The article appears in the journal *Journal of Science Communication* (JCOM). According to their website:

"JCOM publishes research that explores a wide range of issues pertinent to the science communication community, including: issues in communication between science and citizens and within the scientific community itself; challenges arising when models for theoretical analysis or practical means to popularize science are used; the changing relation between science and social institutions; and the informative, pedagogical, interpretative and political dimensions of science communication."

As a quick check to see if you have the right context, answer the following question.

## First-pass Reading

Now that we have some context for the article, we can take a first pass reading of the article. [Download the pdf of the article here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-7P587RK4vVWd0OIr7tV-1g5sikIr17V/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} As before, make sure you save a copy on your computer, and on this first-pass, you should lightly annotate the document, without making any major annotations yet. You may just want to circle unfamiliar vocabulary or concepts though.

After you have finished the first-pass reading, answer the following questions. 


#### Mini-question: What does Kahan claim?

-----------------------------------------

## Second-pass Reading

On this pass, you will be carefully annotating the text. We would like you to annotate every paragraph, by making two types of annotations: 

1. Summarize the main idea of each paragraph/section

2. Summarize the function of each paragraph/section

These ideas are explained in this document ["Annotating a Text.pdf"](images/Annotating a Text.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Please read the instructions and skim the example annotated text before you start on your second-pass reading. 

Once you are finished with your annotations, please [upload a pdf of your annotations using this form](https://forms.gle/LjqYjEvANCLunSjZ7){:target="_blank"}.


-----------------------------------------

## Third-pass reading

Make a final pass of your annotated copy of Kahan, and make notes about how you might answer the following discussion questions **with evidence from the text**. We will ask you about these in our class discussion, so have your notes handy for class.


+ In your own words, summarize the problem that Kahan is trying to address.

+ What are the two main claims Kahan puts forward in his article? 

+ What is "Popper's revenge" and how does it relate to Kahan's claims?

+ Looking at Figures 5 & 6, for issues that are unpolarized (e.g. radio wave risk from cell phones), is there any difference in the perception of risk between liberal/democrats compared to conservative/republicans?  Does lack of polarization implies that members of the general public largely agree in their assessment of risk in these cases?

+ Does Kahan think that people undergo a different decision making process when assessing the risk of unpolarized issues compared to polarized issues?
