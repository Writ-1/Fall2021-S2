# Quickwrite 4

A Quickwrite is a short (5-10 minute) in-class writing activity. We usually use them as a tool to help launch into discussion. Also note, these Quickwrites will come in handy later in the semester when you write your Reflective Essay. So open up Microsoft Word or Google Docs on your computer and start typing...

#### Prompt

*What would you like to discuss with the class today? What questions do you have for your instructors about thesis development or about the source materials? Be as specific as possible, and use this time to organize your thoughts into writing.*
