# Case study overview

**Due Sunday September 5, 5pm**

There are three case studies that we will be examining using the lens of our framing pieces. In your assignment this weekend which will take 3-4 hours total, we would first like you to spend about 30 minutes on each case study getting context and doing a first-pass reading of the materials. We recommend that you set a timer, so you don't accidentally spend too long on one case study over another.

After your first-pass of all three case studies, we would then like you to decide which case study you would like to focus in on. To make your decision, you might think of ways that the case studies connect to the framing pieces. You might want to use Figdor to look at the role of journalists in a case study, for example. Or maybe you want to use Kahan to look at the role of cultural identity in a case study. Please make your selection on this [Case Study Sign Up Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L-Tp2dbHMG1d-6o3OvGxiLE9NP3Djk1hTeFgRjd4neU/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. There is a limit of 5 students per case study so that we can have an even discussion of the different case studies. Your choice here doesn't affect which case study you will write about in your main essay.

After you make your decision, then go back to that case study and perform a detailed second-pass reading. Annotate the materials for case study of choice as we did for our framing pieces. This will likely take an additional 1.5-2.5 hours. Please take this time to carefully go through the subtle details of your case study. 

With that overview out of the way, please start on your first-pass reading of the case studies:

1. [Climate Change](climate-change)
2. [Food and Brand Lab](food-and-brand-lab)
3. [Shrimp Fight Club](shrimp-fight-club)
