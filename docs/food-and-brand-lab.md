## Overview and First-Pass Reading

*Set a timer now for 30 minutes so you have time for the other case studies*

#### Context


##### Stephanie Lee
A quick introduction about Stephanie Lee from her bio in the Science Writers 2019 conference:

"Stephanie M. Lee writes about science, health, technology, commerce, and society. Her feature and investigative stories are about scientific misconduct and conflicts of interest; the research reproducibility crisis in food, fitness, and psychology; the online dissemination of scientific misinformation; the business of dieting and wellness; genetics; biohacking; and digital health, food, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical companies. Before joining BuzzFeed News in 2015, she was a reporter at the San Francisco Chronicle, where she covered biotech, health, and local politics."

##### Brian Wansink

From wikipedia:

"Brian Wansink is a former American professor and researcher who worked in consumer behavior and marketing research. He is the former executive director of the USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) (2007–2009) and held the John S. Dyson Endowed Chair in the Applied Economics and Management Department at Cornell University, where he directed the Cornell Food and Brand Lab.

Wansink's lab researched people's food choices and ways to improve those choices. Starting in 2017, problems with Wansink's papers and presentations were brought to wider public scrutiny. These problems included conclusions not supported by the data presented, data and figures duplicated across papers, questionable data including impossible values, incorrect and inappropriate statistical analyses, and "p-hacking". As of 2020 Wansink has had 18 of his research papers retracted (one twice), seven others have received an expression of concern, and 15 others have been corrected. On September 20, 2018, Cornell determined that Wansink had committed scientific misconduct and removed him from research and teaching activities; he resigned effective June 30, 2019."

#### First-pass reading

There's a lot here, so please don't feel the need to read everything on this first pass. Start on a first-pass reading of 
 ["Here’s How Cornell Scientist Brian Wansink Turned Shoddy Data Into Viral Studies About How We Eat"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1geUN4k-SDrxAK9kMH0W6bxkMbUFPJlgI/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. After that, if you still have time in your 30 minute timer, then skim through some of the other materials.


After your 30 minutes are up, please attempt the following question:

#### Mini-question: Food and Brand Lab Case Study Pairing

Now that you've done a first pass reading of the Food and Brand Lab Case Study, please proceed to case study [3. Shrimp Fight Club](shrimp-fight-club).

**Stop here, unless you have completed all of the other case study first-pass readings and have chosen to focus on the Food and Brand Lab as your selected case study.**

## Second Pass Reading

So you've chosen the Food and Brand Lab Case Study! Great choice! Definitely among the top 3 best case studies for our topic. 

Re-read ["Here’s How Cornell Scientist Brian Wansink Turned Shoddy Data Into Viral Studies About How We Eat"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1geUN4k-SDrxAK9kMH0W6bxkMbUFPJlgI/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} and perform a detailed second-pass reading. Annotate this article like we did for our framing pieces. Also identify a few other important pieces of the case study and annotate them as well. This will likely take an additional 1.5-2.5 hours. Please take this time to carefully go through the subtle details this case study.

**Once you finish annotating**, please upload your annotations/notes [here at this Google Form](https://forms.gle/fDgz88KimHer7tEF7){:target="_blank"}.

#### Discussion questions

After annotating and before class this week, think of aspects of the case study that you'd like to discuss with others. As with the previous readings, a good place to start is with the main ideas:

+ In your own words, summarize the events in the case study.

+ What parts did journalists play in the case study? What's different about the type of writing Martha White was doing compared to Stephanie Lee?

+ What parts did scientists play in the events described in this case study?
 Think of both the scientists in Wansink's lab, and external scientists as well.

+ What are ways that the case study connects to Figdor? Find specific textual evidence from both to support the connection.

+ What are ways that the case study connects to Kahan? Find specific textual evidence from both to support the connection.

**These last two questions will seed our discussion this week. Please prepare typed answers to them so you can easily collaborate with your classmates (you will copy-paste these answers into a shared Google Doc, so please have them ready).**
